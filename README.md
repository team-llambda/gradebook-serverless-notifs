In order to send users notifications when assignments are entered, we need to constantly poll user's grades so we can check for any changes in their grades. This can be slow and resource-intensive in for the servers GradeBook currently uses. As a result, we're adopting a serverless technique to lower the cost and computational overhead of each individual request. 

This repository is a serverless API that queries student grades to inform GradeBook of changes in grade.
